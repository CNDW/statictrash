    p Trash Bags was started in 2008 by me, Andy Larson, a longtime bike messenger (10 years +) from Minneapolis, MN. Over the course of my courier career I used a variety of different bags. From old army issue backpacks to modern courier bags, each seemed to lack something in usability, be it ‘haulability’, comfort, or toughness. I set out to make a messenger bag that was not only rugged tough and waterproof, but also comfortable and able to carry cargo - big and small, from envelopes to file boxes to food orders. With these goals in mind, Trash Bags was born.

    h3 These bags are tested & retested.
    p I won’t let a bag design out of the shop without it passing extensive testing. We are constantly testing the bags on the streets of Minneapolis; Even the first edition Trash Bags are still in use, they can be found on the backs of messengers riding through downtown Minneapolis, standing the ultimate usability test - being put through the day-to-day abuse that only courier work can provide; also, I still work as a messenger and can assure you that Trash Bags can take whatever Minnesota weather can dish out.
    p In a lot of ways, you can boil down my approach to Trash Bags to a couple of things: I come from a family of craftsmen, so I grew up around people who value detail and artistic integrity. I’ve been a bike messenger for over ten years, a job that involves hard work, dedication and has a definite independent streak and I bring all of that background to Trash Bags. Each bag is a representation of those qualities: I hand select all of the materials that go into the bags, and on every bag, every bit of work, from the first cut of the raw fabric to the final stitch is done in shop. I work hard to keep Trash’s supplies domestic whenever possible and will never sacrifice the quality of goods for the bottom line. It’s why I offer a lifetime guarantee for every stitch in your Trash Bag.
    h3 Each bag is unique, there will never be a factory pumping them out.
    p Trash will never be a huge company, but that’s by design. I want to make you your bag, rather than a bag that just happens to be yours. There will never be a factory pumping them out by the thousands, each bag being made by hundreds of hands in some factory location. Everything gets made in our 800 square foot downtown Minneapolis workshop.
    p Trash Bags continues to grow, but never at the expense of quality. You can be sure that if you order from Trash, you’ll be dealing directly with the people who will make your bag—we’re happy to answer your questions and help you get exactly the bag you want—details are important.
    p If you see me on the streets, stop and say hello. You can find me in the Trash workshop Mon – Fri, and out and about at bike events in Minneapolis and beyond.
    p Cheers, <br>Andy Larson <br>Trash Bags
